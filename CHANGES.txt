CHANGES
*******

0.6 (2016-04-06)
================

- Adds compatibility with Morepath 0.13.

0.5 (2015-08-17)
================

- Fixes transaction retries not working for paths with more than one variable.
  
  This bug had no effect on applications using the default more.transaction
  settings. The bug only concerned applications using an ``attempts`` setting
  greater than 1.

  See https://github.com/morepath/more.transaction/issues/3

0.4 (2015-01-06)
================

- Rename ``transaction_app`` to ``TransactionApp`` to be consistent
  with modern class naming in Morepath. Still provide
  ``transaction_app`` for backwards compatibility.

- Modify ``setup.py`` to use ``io.open`` instead of ``open`` to
  include the README and the CHANGELOG and hardcode UTF-8 so it works
  on all versions of Python with all default encodings.

0.3 (2014-11-03)
================

- Compatibility fixes for Morepath 0.7.

0.2 (2014-11-01)
================

- Adjustments to work with Morepath 0.4 and later. (long overdue release,
  thanks Denis Krienbühl for helping me find out!)

0.1 (2014-04-08)
================

- Initial public release.
